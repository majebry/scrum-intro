					# Scrum

					- A simple framework for organizing, managing and delivering work
					- Simple to understand, difficult to master. They say :/
					- "Scrum is not going to fix your problems. It will expose them!"

					- Hosts the rituals
					- Maintains the artifacts
					- Assists to remove blockers
					- Protects the team
					- Coaches the team about Scrum

				</section>
			</section>

			<section data-background="#607D8B">
				<section data-markdown>
					#### Product Owner

					One of the most critical duties of a product owner is clarifying the needs of the customer, developing a
					backlog of product features to work on, and writing clear stories that communicate the full expectations for
					the product, while meeting the standards of the team.
				</section>

				<section data-markdown>
					#### Product Owner Main Responsibilities

					- Meets regularly with customers
					- Writes user stories
					- Works directly with designers
					- Gets technical approval from developers

					- Writes code
					- Participates in the rituals
					- Works with the scrum master to remove blockers
				</section>

				<section data-markdown>
					##### Pair Programming

					![alt text](images/pair-programming.jpg)
				</section>

				<section data-markdown>
					##### Pair Programming

					Pair programming is the practice of two people share a single monitor, and trade responsibility for entering
					code and keeping track of what needs to happen next. A pair should be talking with each other constantly as
					they work, and neither member of a pair should allow distractions such as email to interfere with the process.
				</section>

				<section data-markdown>
					#### Scrum Team Members

					- The team has the right to reject stories that are not fully clear
					- The team is expected to push back against any attempts to sacrifice quality for the sake of speed
					- Every member of the team is also responsible for maintaining the scrum process
				</section>

			</section>

			<section data-background="#607D8B">
				<section data-markdown>
					#### Team Resources

					- Designers
					- QA Engineers
				</section>

				<section data-markdown>
					##### Designers

					Designers have become elemental in all phases of product development, from initial problem definition through
					wireframing, creating style guides, building graphical assets, validating visual consistency, and doing user
					experience testing.
					Designers work closely with product owners during the development of new stories.
				</section>

				<section data-markdown>
					##### QA Engineers

					Ideally, QA should be considered part of the team's definition of "done" for any story. This means that QA
					engineers should start writing the tests for a story at the same time that developers are creating the code.
				</section>
			</section>

			<section data-background="#607D8B">
				<section data-markdown>
					#### Summary

					- A scrum master hosts the rituals, supports the team, and evangelizes the scrum process, both inside and
					outside of scrum.
					- A product owner maintains the vision and direction of the product, and is responsible for interacting with
					the customer.
					- A development team is made up of engineers who organize themselves to estimate and do the work to build the
					product.

				<section data-markdown>
					###### The Prime Directive

					"Regardless of what we discover, we understand and truly believe that everyone did the best job they could,
					given what they knew at the time, their skills and abilities, the resources available, and the situation at
					hand."
				</section>

				<section data-markdown>
					##### Sprint Retrospective | TimeBox

					It's important for the retro ritual to have enough time for its objective, half a day in 2 weeks sprints is a

					### Scrum Artifacts

					"Artifacts" are the tools of scrum that allow teams to manage their scrum process.
				</section>

				<section data-markdown>
					### Scrum Artifacts

					- Story
					- Product Backlog
					- Sprint Backlog
					- Scrum Board
					- Definition of "done"
					- Sprint Goal
					- ...
				</section>
			</section>

			<section data-background="#03A9F4">
				<section data-markdown>
					### Stories

					- Stories are how the "product owner" communicates to the development team what needs to be developed.
					- A story should capture a complete (small) slice of functionality.
					- Every story should add to the value of the product,
					- Stories Are not Technical Specifications!
				</section>

				<section data-markdown>
					### Stories

					The responsibility for writing the stories belongs to the product owner.
					Writing stories that capture the full intention and expectations of the client is a skill that may take time
					to develop,
					but it's critical to an effective scrum process.
					A good "scrum master" should be able to help coach the product owner in how to write stories that are the
					right size and express the appropriate "acceptance criteria".
				</section>

				<section data-markdown>
					#### Story Formula

					Name: brief understandable feature name
					- As a *type of user*
					- I want to *behavior*
					- so that *justification for the behavior*

					Acceptance Criteria:
					- Given a *defined state*
					- when a *set of conditions or events*
					- then a *consistent and testable result*
				</section>

				<section data-markdown>
					#### What makes for a good story?

					A good story is short and straightforward.
					Many scrum teams follow the convention that a story should be able to be written on one side of an index card,
					<!-- three inches by five inches, with the acceptance criteria written on the back of the same card.
					If it takes more than that much information to write down the story, the specifications may be too detailed,
					or story may be too complex, and may need to be broken down into multiple stories. -->
				</section>

				<section data-markdown>
					#### Story Example
					Name: Rating Gallery Images
					- As a gallery viewer
					- I want to rate the images
					- so that I can track and rank the images I've rated
				</section>

				<section data-markdown>
					#### Story Example Acceptance Criteria:
					- Given a logged-in user viewing a gallery
					- when the user clicks a star in a rating widget for an image
					- then the value of that star should be recorded as that user's rating for that image
				</section>

				<!-- <section data-markdown>
					#### Story Example Acceptance Criteria 2:
					- Given a logged-in user viewing a gallery
					- when an image the user has rated is displayed
					- then the rating widget should reflect the user's previously entered rating
				</section> -->

				<section data-markdown>
					#### Story Real-life Example
					Name: View Subscription Plans
					- As a User
					- I want to view Subscription Packages
					- So that I can compare between them and choose the appropriate package for me
				</section>

				<section data-markdown>
					#### Story Example Acceptance Criteria:
					- Given a user viewing the app
					- When the user chooses to view packages
					- then a list of package specifications should appear to them
				</section>
				
				<!-- <section data-markdown>
					#### Story Example Assets
					For a story such as this one,
					the team may have a standard for how wireframes or designs get attached to stories and communicated.
					For example, if this is a new widget, the "designer" may have prepared a mockup and a set of assets
					that the "engineers" will need in order to implement the feature.
				</section> -->

				<section data-markdown>
					### Stories

					When a story is presented at sprint planning,
					the engineers should verify that all of the necessary assets and information they'll need have been captured
					and are available.
					The actual work to be done in the upcoming sprint is defined by the description
					on the story card and the dialogue it inspires between the product owner and the team.
				</section>

				<!-- <section data-markdown>
					### Tasks
					A task usually does not deliver any tangible user value. But tasks need to be done, and a negotiation needs to
					happen between the team and the product owner during the sprint planning if the team recognizes that necessary
					work to keep systems maintainable and avoid technical debt is being deferred in favor of new features.
				</section> -->

					### Product Backlog

					![alt text](images/backlog.png)
				</section>

				<section data-markdown>
					### Product Backlog

					Stories for the development team emerge from the product owner's product backlog.
					A product backlog keeps track of all the input the product owner has about the direction of the product from
					the client,
					along with the research, experience testing, design, and engineering feedback the product owner has gathered.
				</section>
			</section>

			<section data-background="#03A9F4">
				<section data-markdown>
					### Sprint Backlog

					![alt text](images/sprint-backlog.png)
				</section>

				<section data-markdown>
					### Sprint Backlog

					The sprint backlog is the set of developer stories that the team has committed to work on during the
					current sprint.
					A sprint backlog is created as part of the sprint planning ritual, and reflects the shared understanding of
					the team, the product owner, and the scrum master of what everybody will be working on for the coming sprint.
				</section>

				<!-- <section data-markdown>
					### Sprint Backlog

					- The product owner may not add or remove stories to the sprint backlog,
					but may rearrange them as necessary to indicate which stories are most important.
					- Each engineer should choose the story at the top of the backlog when needs something new to do.
				</section> -->

				<!-- <section data-markdown>
					#### Making Major Changes to Stories Within a Sprint

					If a significant change needs to be made to the stories in the sprint backlog,
					and that change really can't wait until the end of the sprint,
					the scrum master should stop the sprint and start a new one,
					with a new sprint planning ritual. Because of the interruption and the cost,
					this is a very drastic option. It should only be employed as a last resort,
					if it's obvious that none of the work being done in the current sprint backlog is appropriate for the changed
					needs of the product owner.
				</section> -->

				<!-- <section data-markdown>
					### Sprint Backlog

					During the sprint, developers pick stories from the top of the sprint backlog every time that they complete a
					story and need something new to do.
					Each engineer should choose the story at the top of the backlog, because that's the one the product owner
					considers the highest priority in the current sprint.
					Picking stories that aren't from the top of the backlog will result in work being done out of priority order.
				</section> -->
			</section>

			<section data-background="#03A9F4">
				<section data-markdown>
					### Definition of Done

					![alt text](images/done.png)
				</section>

				<section data-markdown>
					### Definition of Done

					It's vital for a team to have a shared idea of what done actually means for itself. Teams should create a
					written definition of done which they maintain as a checklist for every story they work on.
				</section>

				<section data-markdown>
					#### Definition of Done

					A definition of done is something the team should come up with together. It may be created during the first
					sprint planning, and iterated on during sprint retrospectives. A team's definition of done may involve
					radically over time, as the team realizes during retrospectives what aspects of the process may need
					improvement.
				</section>

				<section data-markdown>
					### Sprint Goal

					- The Sprint Goal is an objective set for the Sprint.
					- Sprint Goals should be specific and measurable.
